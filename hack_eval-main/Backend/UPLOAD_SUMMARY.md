## 🎨 Frontend Integration

The system includes a React component (`TeamPSUpload.jsx`) in the admin portal that provides:

- Drag & drop Excel file upload
- Real-time data validation
- Upload progress tracking
- Success/error reporting
- Data preview

## 📝 Notes

1. **Missing Data**: Some fields like roll numbers, emails, and contacts were not available in the original Excel file, so they're marked as "N/A"

2. **Column Mapping**: The script automatically mapped the Excel columns to the database structure:
   - `Team Name` → `team_name`
   - `Select Category` → `problem_statement.category`
   - `Problem Statement Name` → `problem_statement.title`
   - `PSID` → `problem_statement.ps_id`
   - `Problem Statement Description as it is in SIH Website` → `problem_statement.description`

3. **Team Members**: The system supports up to 5 team members as per the Excel structure

4. **Unique IDs**: Each team gets a unique `team_id` in the format `TEAM_XXXXXXXX`

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. **Start the Backend**: Run `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. **Test the API**: Use the Swagger UI at `/docs`
3. **Integrate Frontend**: Use the `TeamPSUpload` component
4. **Add More Data**: Upload additional Excel files as needed
5. **Customize**: Modify the schema or add new fields as required

## 🎉 Success!

Your MongoDB collection is now populated with all 70 teams from the Excel file. The system is ready to use and can handle additional uploads, updates, and queries as needed!
